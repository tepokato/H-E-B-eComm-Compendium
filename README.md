# H-E-B-eComm-Compendium

H‑E‑B eComm Compendium is a single-page hub that keeps eCommerce partners focused on their shift. The site bundles the tools, contacts, and references partners need into one organized view:

- **Apps we use:** Launch core tools by workstream (all partners, curbside/delivery/3PSD, digital coupons) with quick context about when to use them.
- **Shift resources:** A military time conversion chart, links to Chat H‑E‑B, and a downloadable digital coupon transaction ID helper.
- **Support & feedback:** Click-to-call/copy chips for critical contacts plus direct links to feedback forms.
- **Tips:** Expandable, workstream-specific reminders and step-by-step guides for common eComm tasks.

The page includes a dark-mode toggle, sticky navigation, and back-to-top control so partners can move quickly without losing their place.
